United Pixelworkers Critique

This page comes off as looking very clean and user friendly. The 
blocks of pictures of clothes make me want to see more and continue 
scrolling down. As you scroll down the page, there are more clothes 
and other items you can buy. There's also a place to put your email 
address to get newsletters. At the top of the page there is a 
toolbar that links you to other places associated with the website. 
I also like how in the upper right hand corner there is the 
shopping art icon that follows you as you scroll down the page. 
This feature is very user friendly and helps customers keep track 
of how many items they have and their running total. 

Overall, I like this website a lot. I like the layout of their 
items and all the colors used. This website definitely keeps 
customers on the page.
