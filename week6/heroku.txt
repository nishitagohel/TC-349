Heroku Critique

Visually, this site is very pleasing and the navigation bar at 
the top makes it easy to explore the website. After seeing last 
weeks website, I especially liked how this site explained what it 
did and what is was on the homepage, so the viewers would not get 
confused about anything. I also liked how the site had a "How it 
Works" page. On this page, it had a diagram that changed colors 
when you scrolled over parts of it. And if you clicked on the 
diagram, more information would be posted on the side of the 
page.
