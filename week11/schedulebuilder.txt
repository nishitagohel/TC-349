MSU Schedule Builder Mobile Site Critique

Compared to a few years ago, the MSU schedule builder critique has changed a lot. Before, the 
mobile site used to be exactly like the online site, which was not very user friendly. Now the site 
looks a lot different than the online site and has big buttons to choose your semester and classes. I 
really like this new update because you can clearly and easily see all the classes you're enrolled in. 
The bad part about this is that when you want to search from classes on your phone, it goes back to 
the online site and it is very hard to see and click on buttons because the sizing isn't how to should 
be on a mobile device.
