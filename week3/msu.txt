MSU Homepage Critique

The MSU homepage comes off as looking very clean and user friendly. The slide show of pictures at the top helps draw people into the webpage and want to see more. As you scroll down the page, the "MSU News" section is useful, as well as the "Events" section. I also think the tool bar at the top was helpful to navigate you to specific locations and to find out more on admissions, academics, and athletics. The search box at the top is probably the best part of the homepage. Although there isn't much information on the homepage that people will want to see on a daily basis, the search box is a quick way to help you get to different MSU department pages, etc.

Overall, the MSU website is a bit hard to navigate through. Especially when you have to find information on your specific college, or area of study. When you search something in the search box, it takes you to a generic page of different links that relates to your search words. In my past experiences, it takes me more time than it should to get to the final page I wanted. I think if the site was easier to navigate to different colleges within MSU the site would be a lot better.
