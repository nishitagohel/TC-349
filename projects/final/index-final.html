<h1>Michigan State Raasparty</h1>

<h2>One Team. One Dance. One Word. Execute!</h2>

<p>The MSU Raas Team is an 18-member dance team that competes at a collegiate level across the US in a form of Indian dance called Garba-Raas. Through hard work, perseverance and dedication we have gone to competitions in Michigan, Florida, Texas, Indiana and Pennsylvania. The MSU Raas Team brings a vibrant, upbeat, and exciting traditional dance to the raas world. Amidst the hectic life of being college students, working towards our careers, and being young adults, we vow to never forget our cultural roots. Through countless hours practicing Raas-Garba dance steps, twirling our dandias, and choreographing synchronized movements, we aim to preserve our heritage and ignite everyoneâ€™s passion for our beloved dance. Sweat, tears, and sacrifice are all present each year to perfect a creative, lively, and colorful dance. MSU Raas is more than a team. We are a family.
