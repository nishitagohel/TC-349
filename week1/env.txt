I chose Dreamweaver because in my CAS 204 Web Design class last semester, we did all our projects in this program. I really like Dreamweaver because it is easy to use and more importantly it is easy to figure out how to use if you don't have any experience in web design. I didn't have any experience in web design before last semester and to start off learning with Dreamweaver was a big help. The design and code split view was extremely helpful becasue I would type some code and I would be able to see exactly what it did in the design view, which was extreamly helpful and convenient.
