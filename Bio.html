<h1>Panic.com Critique</h1>
<p> My first thoughts on this website were that it was a very clean and user freindly website. I loved the big buttons that also explained where each link would take you when you scrolled over it. The homepage was very clean and set up in a logical way - with its main links at the top and towards the bottom was their twitter link, and a place to request for help. 
<p>When you click on any of the links at the top, for example, Coda, it redirects you to that site. This site is also set up in a very user friendly and logical way. There is clearly a button at the top that will take you on a tour of the site. And if you scroll down, it lists off all the new and improved features Coda has. 
<p>My overall impression of this site is very good. It is very user freindly and is not overwhelming to the eye, so viewers are likely to stay on the site and explore what it has to offer.
