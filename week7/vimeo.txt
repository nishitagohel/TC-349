Vimeo Critique 

I think this website has one of the best set ups I have seen. At 
the very top of the webpage, there is a place to make your own 
account, which is great becasue it is the first thing users see. I 
also like how clear and consice the wesite is under the "Join", 
"Log In", and "Upload" tabs. My favprite part of the homepage is 
the "What can you do here?" section. In this area of the page, it 
has clear pictures and descriptions of the different thing 
available to do on this website if you create an account. I also 
like hw at the bottom of the homepage there is another spot to 
"Join Vimeo" so visitors do not have to scroll all the way back to 
the top of the page. Overall, I really like the set up of the 
homepage, as well as the other pages on this site. The site is easy 
to use and visually pleasing to be one.
