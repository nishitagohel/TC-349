\f0\fs24 \cf0 Etsy Critique\
\
	Etsy is an online shopping website. The site is set up very logically and is very user friendly.\
The pictures of the items being sold is very helpful, and it makes it a lot faster to shop and see what \
you are buying. I also like how the prices are clearly listed under the picture of the item before you \
even scroll over the image or click  on it. \
	The toolbar on the left side of the webpage is also very helpful. It categorizes their items \
in a logical way, which makes the site even more user friendly. The search bar at the very top \
of the site is also extremely helpful and convenient. The "Recently sited Items" is also very \
convenient and a good idea to incorporate into the website because with all the item being sold on \
the site, this feature shows visitors newly added items, which helps the sellers out. \
	i also really like when you click on an item, there is a chart to show how much shipping\
will cost and there is also a description of the item being sold. \
	Overall, the site if very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing, which makes buyers/visitors\
 want to use the site again. }
