MSU Mobile Critique

The MSU Mobile site is actually very user friendly. I was surprised 
to find this out when I visited the site on my phone because the 
actual site is not very user friendly in my opinion. On the mobile 
site, I like the big icons for each page you can go to. After you 
click on one of the icons, it takes you to another page with a 
vertical toolbar menu that takes you to an even more specific page. 
I think the mobile site is a lot easier to use and easier to find 
information from rather than the actual website online. Because 
this is a mobile site it is supposed to be simple and take you to 
the most important information on each page that people would want 
to know, and this mobile site does exactly this. Overall, the 
mobile site is user friendly and very easy to use.
