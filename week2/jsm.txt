JASON SANTA MARIA CRITIQUE

Off Book, The Art of Web Design Video:
	This video went over how a website should be user friendly 
and a wed page is different from print. Structure and following 
the grid is also a very important part of web pages. If 
designers following this set up, they will have a successful 
website where viewers will enjoying going to. As mentioned in 
video, Etsy is one of those websites where the setup is very
userfriendly and asthetically pleasing. Designers need to look
at their web pages from an outsiders point of view in order to 
be successful and have people want to visit their site. 
I think the most important thing mentioned in this video was 
when it was said that "design is about serving people's needs".
If it doesn't, then not many people will come back to that site.
