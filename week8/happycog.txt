Happy Cog Critique

	When I first went to this website, I had no idea what to expect 
or what the website was about. After the page loaded, there was a 
description at the top that said what Happy Cog was about. Although 
it was vague, you could figure out more about the site as you 
scrolled down the hompage to get to the "About" section. 
	I also liked all the pictures and colors used in the site. It 
made me want to stay on the site longer to figure out more of what 
it offered. 
	Furthermore, I liked the "News" section of the site. This also 
helped me learn more about what Happy Cog was because you could see 
how they're incorporated and used in the real world.
