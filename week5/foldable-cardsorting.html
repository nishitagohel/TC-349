<p>*Card sorting charts are read from top to bottom</p>

<p>My card sortings were exactly the same as how the website was arranged. Becasue they were the same I think this shows that the website was set up in a very logical and user friendly way. Friends #1 and #2 also had the same set up and I did for the website. Friend #3 had a different set up and idea for the site. She had it set up so when you click on a category, it will take you to a whole new page with your current design. Also, within that page she had some sub categories, as shown under Face Shape. In all honesty I did not like the way she had her set up because I thought it was confusing.
