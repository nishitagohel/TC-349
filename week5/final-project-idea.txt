Final Project Design Ideas

For my final project I am going to make a website for the
Michigan State Raas Team. The MSU Raas team is an Indian dance team which I have been on for the past 2 years. I have made a website for the team before, but now that I am learning more
about web design I think I can make it even better. I want
the website to be interactive and have pictures and videos
of the team dancing. Overall, I want the website to be a
place where people can go and learn more about what we do.
