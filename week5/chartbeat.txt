Chartbeat Critique

I thought this website was very visually pleasing. I liked the 
colors and the cleanliness of it. I also really liked how there 
was a counting widget on the page.
	The main thing I did not like about the website was how hard 
it was for me to figure out what the website was about/for. It 
took me some time and a lot of reading in order for me to figure 
out what the site was for. In my opinion, the site should have a 
blurb about itself at the very top for people visiting it to 
learn more about what they do. 
	Because it took me some time to realize what the site was 
for, I did not really like it even though it looks very nice.
