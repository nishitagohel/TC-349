<p>*My card sortings were the same as my 3 friends card sortings for this website</p>

<p>My friends and I all ended up with the same crd sorting set up for this website idea. I think this setup works the best becasue it is clearly organized in a logical way under 4 different pages. When people visit the page they will be directly on the Home page where it will explain what the Raas Team is and what we do. On the Team "Raaster" page will be a team picture with all the teammates names on it. The next page is the Competitions page. That page will have videos of our performances at different competitions alond with our placing at that specific competition. The last page will be the Gallery page that will have pictures of teh team during competition weekends.
